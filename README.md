## About The Project

Legal documents are often filled with dense jargon and hidden clauses that can be intimidating and risky for the average person. LexiShield AI leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to transform these complex texts into simple, actionable insights.

This project was built by the **Generative Gray Hats** team for the **Google GenAI Exchange Hackathon 2025**.

### Core Features

* **üìÑ Legal Document Summarizer:** Instantly generates a plain-English summary of a document's key points.
* **üìñ Jargon Buster:** Identifies and explains complex and ambiguous clauses in simple terms.
* **üîç Loophole Detector:** Scans for common missing clauses, contradictions, and unfair terms to protect the user.
* **‚öñÔ∏è Asymmetry Detector:** A unique feature that finds imbalanced clauses that unfairly benefit one party over the other.
* **üí¨ Legal Chatbot:** An interactive chat to get instant answers to specific questions about the uploaded document.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have **Node.js (v14+)** and **Python (v3.8+)** installed on your machine.

### Local Setup Instructions

1.  **Get a Free Gemini API Key**
    * Go to the **[Google AI Studio website](https://aistudio.google.com/)**.
    * Click **"Get API key"** and create a new key. Copy it for the next step.

2.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HarshSarnaik/LexiShield-AI.git](https://github.com/HarshSarnaik/LexiShield-AI.git)
    cd LexiShield-AI
    ```

3.  **Setup the Backend** (Run in your first terminal)
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend folder
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file and add your API key
    echo "GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'" > .env
    # (Now, open the .env file and paste your actual key)

    # Run the Flask server
    flask run
    ```
    Your backend is now running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

4.  **Setup the Frontend** (Run in a **new, separate** terminal)
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend folder
    cd frontend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Run the React application
    npm start
    ```
    Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` where you can use the application.
